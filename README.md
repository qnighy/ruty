## Ruty: the typed Ruby

This is **soon-to-be** the new language that adds type annotation to Ruby.

## Implementation progress

This is still roughly 5% of the planned MVP.
Do not expect anything useful now.

Nonetheless it already has all the parts
in the planned pipeline, namely:

- Parser
- Typechecker
- LSP
- VS Code extension serving the LSP

## How to try

You need Rust and Node.js for trying it out.

```
$ cd vscode
$ yarn build && yarn open-in-browser
```

## Why not the existing this or that?

To be explained someday...
